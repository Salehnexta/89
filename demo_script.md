# AI Travel Assistant Investor Demo Script

## Demo Overview

This script outlines a structured demonstration of the AI Travel Assistant's capabilities for investors. The demo showcases the assistant's ability to help users plan trips, search for flights and hotels, and provide travel information using advanced AI technology powered by the DeepSeek API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have a valid DeepSeek API Key in your `.env` file
2. Start the backend server: `python -m app.main`
3. Start the frontend server: `python -m frontend.gradio_app`
4. Open the Gradio interface at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (1 minute)

- Briefly explain the AI Travel Assistant concept
- Highlight the key features: trip planning, flight/hotel search, travel information
- Showcase the professional UI with travel-themed design
- Mention the tech stack: LangGraph, FastAPI, Gradio, and DeepSeek API
- Emphasize the flexibility of the architecture that allows switching between different language models

### 2. Trip Planning Demo (3 minutes)

**Conversation Flow:**

1. **User**: "I'm planning a trip to Paris for a week in June with my partner. We're interested in art and food."

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should recognize the intent to start planning a trip, extract parameters (destination: Paris, dates: June, travelers: 2, interests: art and food), and begin creating a draft package.

2. **User**: "What are the best times to visit museums in Paris?"

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should provide information about museum visiting hours, potentially mention specific museums like the Louvre, and suggest optimal times to avoid crowds.

3. **User**: "We'd also like to visit some vineyards. Can you recommend any day trips?"

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should update the draft with this new preference and suggest vineyard day trips from Paris, possibly to Champagne or Loire Valley.

### 3. Flight Search Demo (2 minutes)

1. **User**: "Can you find flights from New York to Paris for June 15-22?"

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should display mock flight search results showing different airlines, prices, and flight times.

2. **User**: "I'd prefer a direct flight in the morning."

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should filter the results to show only direct morning flights.

### 4. Hotel Search Demo (2 minutes)

1. **User**: "Now I need a hotel in central Paris near the Louvre."

   *Expected Response:* The assistant should display mock hotel search results showing different hotels, prices, and amenities.
